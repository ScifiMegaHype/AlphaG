## What is αG?

The significant goal metric is generally calculated by determining the significance of a scored based on various factors. These factors may vary depending on the mathematical model, but include the ranking or the team the player plays for, ranking of the opponent scored against, the difference the goal makes on the match final score and other characteristics. Each goal is then given a value, representing the goal's impact. For example, a 2024/2025 Harry Kane champions league goal for Bayern Munich vs Dinamo Zagreb in a 9-2 win for Bayern is worth 0.26 and a Bukayo Saka goal for Arsenal in a 2-0 win against PSG is worth 0.98. We can now also mathematically quantify what scoring for is and is not.

I would like to define αG as the much needed mathematical context of goals. 

## What even look at αG?

There are 2 answers to this question, the techical and most important one and the real one, you can decide which is which.
1. Significant Goals totals can be used to determine the importance of a player's goals regardless of the team they play for. This is especially important for goal scorers that play exceptionally for weaker teams. The αG metrics puts scorers on a level playing field. It is a guide to figuring out if a player could do it on a cold night in Stokes without actually being in Stokes.
2. Messi vs Ronaldo. I wanted to create an objective measure of the significance of the goals scored across the 2 careers to add fuel to the never ending Messi vs Ronaldo "debate".  

## How do we get αG??

The metric is relatively simple to calculate. It measures the difference in rank of the team the scorer plays for vs the team they scored against, the game's final score and aggregates the goal based on these factors.

## Here is a baseline: 

If Real Madrid plays Real Madrid and Mbappe scores for one of the real madrid sides and the match ends at 1-0, Mbappe's αG for that macth would be 1. If the match ends as a 1-1 draw, his αG wiould be 0.75 and if they lose 2-1, his αG would be 0.625. αG clearly signifies the impact of a goal on the final match outcome.

## Application

As of the 20th of December 2024, using all the goals scored in the 2024/2025 Uefa Champions League campaign, Viktor Gyokeres has been the most impactful goal scorer in the competition with 5 goals and a αG value of 4.7. 3 of his goals came against Manchester City. On αG, he is followed Lille's by Jonathan David who scored 4 goals with a αG value of 4.66. David's scored a winner against the defending chmapions, Real Madrid, 2 game setting goals against Athletico Madrid and a goal in a draw against Juventus. 

All players without a goal have an αG of 0. As of the 20th of December 2024, the player with the lowest non zero αG (0.06) in this year's champion's league campaign is Endrick who scored 1 goal, a 90th minute goal for Real madrid against VfB Stuttgart in a 3-1 Real Madrid win. The current competition top goal scorer is Robert Lewandowki with 7 goals and a αG value of 2.57. 

Up until this point, αG seems like a measure that understates the significance of scorers playing for big teams and overstates the significance of scorers playing for smaller teams. Robert Lewandowski's teammate Raphinha is having the season of his life and the αG data agrees. Raphinha is third in the αG top scorer with 6 goals for barcelona and αG value of 4.07, a αG value 1.5 above Lewandowski with 1 less goal. The αG metric highlights the impact of goals and not the quantity.
